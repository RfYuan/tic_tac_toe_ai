"# tic_tac_toe_ai" 

This project contains tic_tac_toe game with 2 AIs, first is constructed using on min_max game, the second is constructed
 using Neural Network. 
 
The main goal for this project is to test the ability of neural network in abstracting and compressing model, i.e. the 
size of neural network should be much less then the min_max gaae tree, without losing accuracy.
